## General info

The goal of this project is to make a site to advertise job offers like Indeed. Thus, we have to work on the Front, but
also on the Back. Indeed it aims to achieve :

- A database to store job offers.

- A web page (front end) using Javascript technologies to display an online job board as well as an administration page for the admin user.
- An API (back end) : 
  * To enable the user to apply for jobs
  * To manage the database (only for the admin user) - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
